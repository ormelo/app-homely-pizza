In our first conversation they explained everything openly which made us feel good. During designing, they were patient to understand our preferences and suggest designs accordingly. We were looking for little unique/varied designs for all the furniture and they were able to provide the variety. Specifically our Foyer unit and TV unit designs came out quite nice. Kitchen design was entirely customized to our needs. Execution was quite smooth and they completed without troubling us much. The schedule was strictly followed without any delays. On possession whatever minor issues we found, they came and fixed them immediately. Price wise they are competitive. Only suggestion I have, follow a more strict handover process with thorough checks.",

It was more like working with a very supportive and like-minded friend on a collage project who is equally passionate about getting the things right with you. She is quick to relate to your ideas and helps you achieve better than what you have been looking for in your home. Apart from being extremely hard working and knowledgeable, she also has an equally competent team that can seamlessly execute her ideas very quickly. Wishing her the very best !",

From the first time we met her we found her to be approachable and understanding, she brought with her a style of patient listening and articulating our thoughts into a working designâ€¦she anchored the conversation, held us to our brief ( she has oodles of patienceâ€¦) and brought in some sanity into the plan. The best part was she heard our needs and even though she had not tried some of the patterns she was open to experiment with it.  Plus the person she brought in, Mr Bhullan Ram ( Sharmaji) for the  execution part do a flawless work helped us realize our longstanding dream of a homeâ€¦.a cozy homeâ€¦.\nIf you see the final product you would realize she married the two worlds, clear lines with ethnic style.

I felt that they don't think about cost cutting and want to make sure the work done is of good quality. Also, I took quotation from 5 different interior companies before choosing V2. Their quote was lowest and payment terms was very convenient. All other interior designers will ask you to pay almost all the amount upfront. I would suggest that you must check their quote and workmanship before awarding the interior work for your flat or office to another interior company.",

Reasonable pricing - Longbell designed and  delivered false ceiling for 4 rooms, wall wooden units for 3 bedrooms, modular kitchen and TV unit. They delivered the project in a reasonable price with comparable quality to higher priced designers \n2. Timeline - They completed majority of the work under stringent timeline. Although it was completed beyond committed timeline, it was still faster than other designers.\n3. Behavior- Krishna, Jitender and team are well behaved. It was always nice discussing with them.\n4.Quality - The quality of work is good. I compared with other designers worked in friends' places and found Longbell has done better work in less price.",

Kitchen design was entirely customized to our needs. Execution was quite smooth and they completed without troubling us much. The schedule was strictly followed without any delays. On possession whatever minor issues we found, they came and fixed them immediately. Price wise they are competitive.
